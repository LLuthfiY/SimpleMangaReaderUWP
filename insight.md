UWP ( universal windows platform ) is platform that based on WIndowss runtime API ( WinRT API), its different from wpf ( windows presentation foundation ) that based on .NET framework and .NETCORE, so i cannot use method from .NET. UWP has more strictly permission when compared with WPF, i cannot use some basic method from basic c# like getFiles(), Directory.Delete() etc. or it will make my app crashed. 

#### so why i choose to make an UWP program instead of WPF?
- first, its new for me.
- second, uwp has better interface than wpf
